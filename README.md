# Roster Access: Karlendar

## Overview
The **Karlendar** project simplifies access to your Air Maestro roster through a personalized calendar link that integrates seamlessly with popular calendar services like Google Calendar, Microsoft Outlook, and Apple Calendar.

This tool ensures your Air Maestro schedule is consistently updated while applying specific adjustments to make your roster more readable and user-friendly. It operates as a **Cloudflare Worker** to fetch, modify, and serve your Air Maestro calendar data.

## Key Features

   - Automatically corrects time zones in events based on Air Maestro outputs.
2. **Event Deduplication**:

3. **All-Day Event Formatting**:
   - Adjusts all-day events like "Rostered Day Off" (RDO) to proper calendar formats.
4. **Simplified Event Titles**:
   - Shortens event names for easier readability (e.g., "RDO - Rostered Day Off" becomes "RDO").
5. **Tasking and Duty Merging**:
   - Combines overlapping events like tasking and duty shifts for a cleaner display.
6. **Sync Awareness**:
   - Adds the last roster sync time to event descriptions for user awareness.
7. **Multiple Calendar Services**:

     - Google Calendar
     - Microsoft Outlook (personal and corporate)
     - Apple Calendar
